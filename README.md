### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Joey-McC/Joey-McC** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- My name is Joey, I'm 16 years old, and I want to have a job that involves coding in the future!
- In game development I'm interested in learning code.
- I'm currently learning Java and slightly learning C# I wish to learn other languages such as C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL
